My wife and I bought a house in eastern Ontario during the spring of
2023, wanting to reduce the distance from friends and family while also
gaining some independence, particularly with being outdoors (our
apartment wasn't great for that; I'm sure our dog and cat concur). Since
then we've been slowly determining what our backyard actually **is** to
us, and what we might do with it. This, combined with a fair amount of
reading about both traditional Indigenous knowledge and modern gardening
practices (where "reading" sometimes also means "watching YouTube") has
led me to start viewing our backyard as an ecological system, and asking
myself how it relates to the others, along with the wider region.

## View From the Deck

Here's how it looked on the evening of April 28th, 2025.

"Backyard, Evening of April 28th, 2025")

And here's how it looked a little over two weeks later (after partially
cutting the very long grass):

I've been considering what it might mean to do a study on this kind of
environment, in a way that's both useful to our future plans as stewards
of the space, and interesting to others who might've had the same idea.
This project would involve collecting quantitative data whenever
possible, composing it along with any other observations we can make.
To make it meaningful as an ecological (and maybe anthropological)
study, it'd need to:

1. Be accessible and repeatable by others without highly-technical
expertise;
2. Span multiple years and scopes;
3. Recognize our place within it, rather than impartial observers.

I'm not formally trained in any sort of biology, ecology, or
environmental science program that would provide a foundation for this
project. However, the process should be doable with access to a library,
the Internet, and/or others with similar experience. We need a good
template - probably a guide or two, with associated spreadsheets for
filling out all sorts of details about the backyard ecology. Keeping it
at this level means the digital tools will remain available from a web
browser and shouldn't require more than a GMail account. I'll have to
start developing a spreadsheet template soon, using observations from my
own backyard as a springboard.

## Practical Considerations

- Given that we live in the shadow of changing climates and
  drastically-reduced habitat for wildlife, tracking observations across
  multiple years seems critical for understanding our impact and changes
  in the local area.
  - These can include anything from precipitation and temperature
    extremes to the presence of specific species of bird, rodent, even
    the odd sighting of larger fauna. I remember hearing on local
    discussion groups about the presence of coyotes in town - I don't
    think they ever came near our house, but it's worth noting, if for
    no other reason than as part of a broader look at the region's
    environmental properties. 
  - It's also definitely worth tracking classifications that existing
    organizations put out for the areas these backyards are located in.
    I'm thinking things like [KÃ¶ppen climate
    classifications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C3%B6ppen_climate_classification)
    and [Plant Hardiness Zones](https://planthardiness.gc.ca/?m=1).
- The best way to track flora and fauna (other than visual
  identification) might be by cross-referencing weight/size/dietary/etc.
  characteristics from Wikipedia, along with other traits as able
- A camera capable of taking photos as much as every hour would be handy
  for timelapse, and possibly motion-sensing

## Equipment/Software Needs

Some/all of the following would be useful:

1. An IP camera that can be accessed via script - automatic, periodic
snapshot collection. Something with motion sense would be even better
2. A variety of instruments like soil samplers, rain gauges,
temperature sensors, and other IoT sensors (if we want to get really
detailed)
3. Public data on biomes, waterways, precipitation, wildlife ranges,
etc.

As far as #1 goes, there are a lot of fairly cheap outdoor,
solar-powered IP security cameras available that might work. I couldn't
find much for soil samplers (the closest I got was [this
site](https://soiltaxguys.com/lawn-garden/), but they seem more
large-scale farming oriented), but rain gauges and temperature
measurement are easy in theory. The public data might be a bit tricker
to collect and could be outdated (see the habitat maps in [this
video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hprN9oyEM7A&pp=ygUJYXRsYXMgcHJv)
as an example).

The language of choice for developing any analysis tools is probably
Python - I'm comfortable with it and it's easy for others to learn. In
addition to generating interesting plots, I'm also wondering about a
massive table contrasting the different physical and temporal
characteristics of things we find.

## Similar Projects

I did some searching for the phrase `backyard ecology` in Google. The
top results seem to be mainly for helping backyard gardeners out, but
there are no deeply technical posts in the first few pages (maybe
there's a reason for that and my approach will have issues). Plenty of
incredibly useful posts and videos, though. I did find
[this](https://gardenecology.pdx.edu/backyard-ecology/index.html) page
from Portland State University. The website [matching the search
phrase](https://www.backyardecology.net/) is about providing a community
and resources for building vibrant backyard ecosystems.

Someone else made a nice [blog](https://backyardecologist.com/) covering
their experiences and tips on popular gardening topics. There's also
Andrew Millison who has an active YouTube
[channel](https://www.youtube.com/@amillison) and teaches some
[courses](https://horticulture.oregonstate.edu/users/andrew-millison)
at Oregon State University. I don't doubt that there are other resources
similar to my idea somewhere, but I'll get started and look along the
way. Notably, searching for `backyard environmental study` seems to get
more content in psychology and news articles about academic programs.

## Impetus, or a Source of Guilt

The second picture above was taken following a near two-week journey to
France. There was a lot of rainfall during and after the trip, to the
point where much of the lawn had grown so tall that it looked more like
a forest meadow, and my unpowered mower wouldn't cut it. While clearing
it with the snipper, I disturbed this creature
([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_leopard_frog)):

![A resident northern leopard frog](20250520_120357.jpg "A resident
northern leopard frog")

I felt bad about it, and it got me thinking of our goals. I'd like to
create a thriving little space for us and small critters, one that
avoids having another over-mowed lawn that's desolate and uninteresting;
but it's also important not to allow harmful and/or invasive species (we
have a little creeping thistle and a lot of wild raspberry, among
others) to overrun it. In particular, I'm interested in seeing a lot
more butterflies around, which will require milkweed for monarchs and a
variety of other additions. Having detailed knowledge of the space
also seems crucial in our role as what are basically small-scale
terraformers, and key to a sense of belonging. My hope is that maybe
I'll get skilled and methodical enough at this project that it'll help
others do the same, and decades from now we'll leverage all of this data
to help achieve a communal understanding of the world that helps some of
those solarpunk quasi-utopias of science fiction.

## Conclusion

That's a scattered assortment of ideas and issues, and there's probably
some stuff I've accidentally omitted. 
Over the next while I'm going to start posting about more specific
adventures - things like camera setup and configuration, snapshots of
flora and fauna with details, and more. It might also make sense for me
to curate little lists of things I find useful and/or related to the
project even if they aren't used. We'll see.
