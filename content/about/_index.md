Hi, I'm Trevor (he/him).

I specialize in embedded Linux and other free and open-source software,
particularly: 

1. The Yocto Project
2. Python tools
3. CI infrastructure
4. Hardware/systems integration and testing
5. Driver development

This site is named "ecocode" because I am interested in ecosystems and
how our social and technological choices relate to them.
